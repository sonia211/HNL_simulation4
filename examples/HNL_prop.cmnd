# This is the commands list to define the new "N" particle.
# The nu_mu (id=14) is used as a basis, and its properties and decays modes are completely reset.


#Change properties with id:all = name antiName spinType(2*s=1) chargeType colType m0 mWidth mMin mMax tau0

14:all = N Nbar 2 0 0 1 1e12 1 10000 1e-12
# flag  ParticleDecays:allowPhotonRadiation   (default = off) 


# Set decay modes from scratch using id:oneChannel = onMode bRatio meMode product1 product2 .... 

# int DecayChannel::onMode()  
# set or get the onMode of a decay channel,
# 0 if a channel is off,
# 1 if on,
# 2 if on for a particle but off for an antiparticle,
# 3 if on for an antiparticle but off for a particle.
# If a particle is its own antiparticle then 2 is on and 3 off but, of course, for such particles it is much simpler and safer to use only 1 and 0.
# The 2 and 3 options can be used e.g. to encode CP violation in B decays, or to let the W's in a q qbar â†’ W^+ W^- process decay in different channels. 

# double DecayChannel::bRatio()  
# set or get the branching ratio of the channel. Second argument only for internal use. 

# int DecayChannel::meMode()  
# set or get the mode of processing this channel, possibly with matrix elements 
# see list of decays on http://home.thep.lu.se/Pythia/pythia82html/ParticleDecays.html
