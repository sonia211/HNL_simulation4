This directory contains several config files

*B_wmeson_HNL*.cmnd:	pythia config files
			c = charged meson -> HNL produced by B+ or Bs
			n = neutral meson -> HNL produced by B0 or Bc
			
			the number after 'HNL' corresponds to the chosen pID
			15: tau, 	corresponds to spin 1/2 model
			25: Higgs,	corresponds to spin 0 model

hnldecayBR_ch*.dat	corresponds to branching ratios computed by ../computeBR.py, using FairShip/python/hnl.py
			ch* : chosen decay channel (pi- mu+; pi+ mu-; ...)
